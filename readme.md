# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [YOUR_FRAMEWORK] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> Quasar is a cross-platform UI framework built on-top of Vue. Say what??
> So that means that it defines pre-baked components that are designed to work well with desktop, web and mobile applications.
> This also means that it's not going to look exactly the same as some of the other front-end implementations of Realworld. THIS IS ON PURPOSE. The other front-ends are not designed to be cross-platform. Quasar is. There will be differences that are impossible to resolve. There will be differences that are possible to resolve. That's left as an exercise for the reader. Here we've tried to keep within the visual style suggested by the Realworld spec and we've used the availble CSS where possible â€“ however for certain elements (such as form inputs) we've left the default Quasar styling in place as we know this works cross-platform.
